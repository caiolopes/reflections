What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	You need to initialize a new repository because otherwise a normal directory will not contain a .git sub-directory with the necessary files which track all the information about your project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	Staging area is a "place" where the information about which files are going to be committed is placed before it is actually committed.
