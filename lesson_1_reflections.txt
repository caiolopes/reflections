How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing a diff between two versions of a file help me save a lot of time and work in searching for it by myself.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    Thinking in the long term, it is good to have the history of a file because you can see all the development on that file, how things have changed, and every time you make a change and want to go back you have a backup.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    I think that the main benefit of needing to commit the changes instead of doing it automatically is that when you do changes you want to test before committing. However, you lose some time doing it manually.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because git is better for projects which involve many files than google docs, which is for single documents like doc, txt, etc.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use git log and git diff every time I need to see some bug or something that has changed between versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you always have saved an old version that works correctly.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use git for my personal projects.
